Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

Visual studio code extensions

Pylint: Linter for python projects helping to force coding standards and identify potential errors

Gitlens: Enhances Git intergration by providing detailed insights into file history, blame information and code authorship

Docker: Adds syntax highlighting, intellisense and docker file support for docker development

Bracket pair colorizer: Colorizes matching brackets to improve readability 

Code spell checker: Checks for spelling errors in your code comments and string

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process.

    Document with steps taken to set up developer environment

1. Influx
Setting up the developer environment requires configuring your device system with necessary tools and software to bring about an efficient software environment. The following are the steps involved in setting up the developer environment.

2. Conditions necessary
Make sure you have a stable internet connection and you have given your device administrative access.

3. Setting up the development environment
   
Installing softwares

(a) Make sure you install Git and configure your user name and email using ‘git config user.name and git config user.email
Install python and set up virtual environments using virtualenv or env

(b) Configuring version control

-Set up a new repository on github to host your projects

(c)  Installing an Integrated Development Environment
      
-Install Visual studio code and customised with extensions of your desired languages and framework for example python

(d)   Setting up packages

-In python, use ‘pip’ to install dependencies    

(e)    Creating virtual environments

- Use virtualenv or venv to create isolated python environments for dependency management in python virtual environment
 
(f)     Dockerizing your application

-Docker: Create a ‘Docker file’ to define your application’s environment and dependencies

-Docker compose: Use ‘docker-compose yml’ to manage multiple containers    

5. Testing  
Testing framework: Set up a testing framework for automated testing, eg pytest
Linting and formatting: Integrate linting tools like pylint and code formatters for code quality

6. Documenting and collaboration:
Create a READ.ME comprehensive file outlining how to set up the environment and run tests and more over contribute to the project
Documentation tools: Use markdown for documentation and possibly sphinx for inline documentation.

7. Continuous Integration / Continuous Considerations (CI/CD)
Setup automated CI/CD pipelines using tools like github Actions for testing, building and deploying your software             

8. Security check up
Intergrate security  security tools like static code analysis tool into your CI/CD pipeline
Secure development: Follow secure coding practices and regularly review code for vulnerabilities      

9. Finalising
The developer environment is successfully set to your project needs

10. Troubleshooting
Networking problems: Ensure a reliable internet connection
Dependency issues: Check compatibility between dependencies and versions
Configuration errors: Verify environment variables and configuration files
                               


#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
